For <a href="http://www.telecomvpn.com.br" title="Tel & Com" target="_blank">Tel & Com</a> we developed an iPad application that reads the data generated by the Communication Circuits monitoring system and is able to generate a variety of financial and availability reports. The application is distributed internally via the Apple Enterprise Program.
