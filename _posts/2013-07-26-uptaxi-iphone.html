In just a few seconds upTaxi locates, via GPS, the closest taxi from your current location. You can visualize the taxi driver’s information and accept or reject his service. After you accept the driver, you can see in a map the route the taxi is taking. You can also contact the taxi driver directly by calling or sending a message. The application is free and available for iPhones, iPads, and Android smartphones and tablets.
