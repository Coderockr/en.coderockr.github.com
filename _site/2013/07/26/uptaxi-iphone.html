In just a few seconds upTaxi locates, via GPS, the closest taxi from your current location. You can visualize the taxi driverâ€™s information and accept or reject his service. After you accept the driver, you can see in a map the route the taxi is taking. You can also contact the taxi driver directly by calling or sending a message. The application is free and available for iPhones, iPads, and Android smartphones and tablets.
